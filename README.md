### Stock Price Prediction Model - v1.3
#### Andrew Castelli - #001488272

This Price Prediction Model was written using Python 3.9.1
Constructed using a combination of PyCharm and Google Colab.

My hypothesis for this project is: If enough historical stock price data is available for any individual stock,
then it can be used to train our recurrent neural network to then accurately predict future stock prices.
Due to the strong correlations between prediction price and actual price, I confidently accept the hypothesis.
